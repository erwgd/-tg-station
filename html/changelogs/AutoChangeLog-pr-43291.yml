  - balance: "Humans now have a punch damage range of 1-10, up from 0-9"
  - balance: "The chance to miss a punch now increases the more stamina and brute damage you have"
  - balance: "The stun duration for a critical punch now scales with how much stamina/brute damage the victim has"
  - balance: "Punches now deal full stamina damage + half damage in brute (effectively 1.5x damage on all punches, not accounting for stamina regeneration)"
  - balance: "Kicking (punching a prone person) does full brute damage, never misses, and does 1.5x damage"
  - balance: "Grabs are now harder to break out of the more stamina/brute damage you have"
  - balance: "Failing to resist out of a grab will deal a bit of stamina damage to you"
  - balance: "In all instances above where both stamina and brute damage are considered, brute is weighed 1/2 as heavily as stamina (meaning stamina has more of an effect than brute when it comes to punch-stun duration, miss chance, etc)"
